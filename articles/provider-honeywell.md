# Honeywell provider

- Publisher: [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com)
- Provider ID: `honeywell`

## Targets

The following targets are available from this provider:

- [API Validator](#api-validator)
- [Honeywell System Model H0](#honeywell-system-model-h0)
- [Honeywell System Model H1](#honeywell-system-model-h1)

### API Validator

Tool to verify proper syntax and compilation completion. Full stack is exercised with the exception of the actual quantum operations. Assuming no bugs, all zeros are returned in the proper data structure.

- Job type: `Simulation`
- Data Format: `honeywell.openqasm.v1`
- Target ID: `honeywell.hqs-lt-1.0-apival`
- Target Execution Profile: [Basic Measurement Feedback](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.targets)

Billing information:  No charge for usage.

### Honeywell System Model H0

Honeywell Quantum Solutions' Quantum Computer, System Model H0

- Job type: `Quantum Program`
- Data Format: `honeywell.openqasm.v1`
- Target ID: `honeywell.hqs-lt-1.0`
- Target Execution Profile: [Basic Measurement Feedback](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.targets)

Billing information:

- Priced by Honeywell Quantum Credits (see below).
- Fee per hour for reserved (exclusive use) time.

| Parameter Name | Type     | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `count`   | int    | No | Number of experimental shots. Defaults to 1. |
| `options` | list | No | Compiler options. Only one option currently supported: `no-opt` to disable all optimization |

The following equation defines how circuits are translated into Honeywell Quantum Credits (HQCs):

$$
HQC = 5 + C(N_{1q} + 10 N_{2q} + 5 N_m)/5000
$$

where:

- $N_{1q}$ is the number of one-qubit operations in a circuit.
- $N_{2q}$ is the number of native two-qubit operations in a circuit. Native gate is equivalent to CNOT up to several one-qubit gates.
- $N_{m}$ is the number of state preparation and measurement (SPAM) operations in a circuit including initial implicit state preparation and any intermediate and final measurements and state resets.
- $C$ is the shot count.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that there is a $30 USD minimum cost to run a job on the Honeywell QPU.
