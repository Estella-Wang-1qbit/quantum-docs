## Targets

### Tabu Search Solver 
An iterative heuristic algorithm that uses local search techniques to solve a QUBO problem. It starts from a random solution and looks for an improved solution in the solution's neighborhood which includes all possible single flips. The algorithm stops when it reaches a stopping criterion, such as a specified number of consecutive iterations without improvement.

****** 
Please note for the parameters values, they are required to be of JSON string type.  The types listed below are the types the solvers expect within the string value.  For example, 'improvement_cutoff' is listed as type int, it is expected to be passed in in the format:

improvement_cutoff: "5"

### PTICM Solver
The parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves (PTICM) solver is a Monte Carlo approach to solving QUBO problems. In this algorithm, multiple replicas of the original system, each with a different initial state, are simulated at different temperatures simultaneously. The replicas at neighboring temperatures are periodically swapped based on a Metropolis criterion. These swaps allow different replicas to do a random walk in the temperature space, thereby, efficiently overcoming energy barriers.

Valid values: "PERSISTENCY", "SPVAR" or "NO_FIXING" Default: NO_FIXING |

### Path-Relinking Solver
The path-relinking algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that uses the tabu search as a subroutine to solve a QUBO problem. The algorithm starts from a set of elite solutions found by the tabu search. It then constructs a path between each pair of elite solutions, selects one of the solutions along the path, and repeats the tabu search. If the tabu search finds a distinct solution that is better than the current worst elite solution, the elite solutions set is updated with the new improved solution. This whole procedure is repeated until the algorithm meets a stopping condition.

| greedy_path_relinking|boolean|Optional|When you use the path-relinking solver there are two ways you can generate a path that leads to the solution: one is the greedy function and the other operates in a random matter. If you set the this parameter to true, the solver will use the greedy function. If you set it to false, it will use the random method. Default: false |
| ref_set_count|int|Optional|The number of initial elite solutions to be generated by the tabu search algorithm.  Valid values: Greater than 1 Default: 10 |
| timeout|int|Optional|The duration in ms the solver runs before exiting. If the value is set to 0, it does not time out. If a value is not specified, the solver uses the default value or estimates a new one based on the input problem. Estimated values are marked as "(COMPUTED)". Default: 0 |
