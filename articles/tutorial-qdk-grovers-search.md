# Tutorial: Implement Grover's search algorithm in Q\#

In this tutorial you'll learn to implement Grover's algorithm in Q# to solve search based problems.

Grover's algorithm is one of the most famous algorithms in quantum computing. The problem it solves is often referred to as "searching a database", but it's more accurate to think of it in terms of the *search problem*.

Any search task can be mathematically formulated with an abstract function $f(x)$ that accepts search items $x$. If the item $x$ is a solution to the search task, then $f(x)=1$. If the item $x$ isn't a solution, then $f(x)=0$. The search problem consists of finding any item $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=1$.

## Grover's algorithm task

Given a classical function $f(x):\\{0,1\\}^n \rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$, where $n$ is the bit-size of the search space, find an input $x_0$ for which $f(x_0)=1$.


To implement Grover's algorithm to solve a problem you need to:

1. **Transform the problem to the form of a Grover's task:** for example, suppose we want to find the factors of an integer $M$ using Grover's algorithm. You can transform the integer factorization problem to a Grover's task by creating a function $$f_M(x)=1[r],$$ where $1[r]=1$ if $r=0$ and $1[r]=0$ if $r\neq0$ and $r$ is the remainder of $M/x$. This way, the integers $x_i$ that make $f_M(x_i)=1$ are the factors of $M$ and we transformed the problem to a Grover's task.
1. **Implement the function of the Grover's task as a quantum oracle:** to implement Grover's algorithm, you need to implement the function $f(x)$ of your Grover's task as a [quantum oracle](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.oracles).
1. **Use Grover's algorithm with your oracle to solve the task:** once you have a quantum oracle, you can plug it into your Grover's algorithm implementation to solve the problem and interpret the output.

## Quick overview of Grover's algorithm

Suppose we have $N=2^n$ eligible items for the search task and we index them by assigning each item an integer from $0$ to $N-1$. The steps of the algorithm are:

1. Start with a register of $n$ qubits initialized in the state $\ket{0}$.
1. Prepare the register into a uniform superposition by applying $H$ to each qubit in the register:
   $$|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{N^{1 / 2}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1}|x\rangle$$
1. Apply the following operations to the register $N_{\text{optimal}}$ times:
   1. The phase oracle $O_f$ that applies a conditional phase shift of $-1$ for the solution items.
   1. Apply $H$ to each qubit in the register.
   1. Apply $-O_0$, a conditional phase shift of $-1$ to every computational basis state except $\ket{0}$.
   1. Apply $H$ to each qubit in the register.
1. Measure the register to obtain the index of an item that's a solution with very high probability.
1. Check if it's a valid solution. If not, start again.

## Write the code for Grover's algorithm

Now let's see how to implement the algorithm in Q#.

### Grover's diffusion operator

First, we are going to write an operation that applies the steps **b**, **c** and **d** from the loop above. Together, these steps are also known as the Grover diffusion operator $-H^{\otimes n} O_0 H^{\otimes n}$

```qsharp
operation ReflectAboutUniform(inputQubits : Qubit[]) : Unit {

    within {
        ApplyToEachA(H, inputQubits);
        ApplyToEachA(X, inputQubits);
    } apply {
        Controlled Z(Most(inputQubits), Tail(inputQubits));
    }

}
```

In this operation we use the [within-apply](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.conjugations) statement that implements the automatic conjugation of operations that occur in Grover's diffusion operator.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about conjugations in Q#, check the [conjugations
> article in the Q# language guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.conjugations).

A good exercise to understand the code and the operations is to check with pen and paper that the operation `ReflectAboutUniform` applies Grover's diffusion operator. To see it note that the operation `Controlled Z(Most(inputQubits),Tail(inputQubits))` only has an effect different than the identity if and only if all qubits are in the state $\ket{1}$.

You can check what each of the operations and functions used is by looking into the API documentation:

- [`ApplyToEachA`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Canon.ApplyToEachA)
- [`Most`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays.Most)
- [`Tail`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays.Tail)

The operation is called `ReflectAboutUniform` because it can be geometrically interpreted as a reflection in the vector space about the uniform superposition state.

### Number of iterations

Grover's search has an optimal number of iterations that yields the highest probability of measuring a valid output. If the problem has $N=2^n$ possible eligible items, and $M$ of them are solutions to the problem, the optimal number of iterations is:

$$N_{\text{optimal}}\approx\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{\frac{N}{M}}$$

Continuing to iterate past that number starts reducing that probability until we reach nearly-zero success probability on iteration $2 N_{\text{optimal}}$. After that, the probability grows again and util $3 N_{\text{optimal}}$ and so on.

In practical applications, you don't usually know how many solutions your problem has before you solve it. An efficient strategy to handle this issue is to "guess" the number of solutions $M$ by progressively increasing the guess in powers of two (i.e. $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^n$). One of these guesses will be sufficiently close that the algorithm will still find the solution with an average number of iterations around $\sqrt{\frac{N}{M}}$.

### Complete Grover's operation

Now we are ready to write a Q# operation for Grover's search algorithm. It will have three inputs:

- A qubit array `register : Qubit[]` that should be initialized in the all `Zero` state. This register will encode the tentative solution to the search problem. After the operation it will be measured.
- An operation `phaseOracle : (Qubit[]) => Unit is Adj` that represents the phase oracle for the Grover's task. This operation applies an unitary transformation over a generic qubit register.
- An integer `iterations : Int` to represent the iterations of the algorithm.

```qsharp
operation RunGroversSearch(register : Qubit[], phaseOracle : (Qubit[]) => Unit is Adj, iterations : Int) : Unit {
    // Prepare register into uniform superposition.
    ApplyToEach(H, register);
    // Start Grover's loop.
    for _ in 1 .. iterations {
        // Apply phase oracle for the task.
        phaseOracle(register);
        // Apply Grover's diffusion operator.
        ReflectAboutUniform(register);
    }
}
```

This code is generic - it can be used to solve any search problem. We pass the quantum oracle - the only operation that relies on the knowledge of the problem instance we want to solve - as a parameter to the search code.

## Implement the oracle

One of the key properties that makes Grover's algorithm faster is the ability of quantum computers to perform calculations not only on individual inputs but also on superpositions of inputs. We need to compute the function $f(x)$ that describes the instance of a search problem using only quantum operations. This way we can compute it over a superposition of inputs.

Unfortunately there isn't an automatic way to translate classical functions to quantum operations. It's an open field of research in computer science called *reversible computing*.

However, there are some guidelines that might help you to translate your function $f(x)$ into a quantum oracle:

1. **Break down the classical function into small building blocks that are easy to implement.** For example, you can try to decompose your function $f(x)$ into a series of arithmetic operations or Boolean logic gates.
1. **Use the higher-level building blocks of the Q# library to implement the intermediate operations.** For instance, if you decomposed your function into a combination of simple arithmetic operations, you can use the [Numerics library](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic) to implement the intermediate operations.

The following equivalence table might prove useful when implementing Boolean functions in Q#.

| Classical logic gate | Q# operation        |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| $NOT$          | `X`                      |
| $XOR$          | `CNOT`                   |
| $AND$          | `CCNOT` with an auxiliary qubit|

### Example: Quantum operation to check if a number is a divisor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this tutorial we are going to factorize a number using Grover's search algorithm as a didactic example to show how to translate a simple mathematical problem into a Grover's task. However, **Grover's algorithm is NOT an efficient algorithm to solve the integer factorization problem**. To explore a quantum algorithm that does solve the integer factorization problem faster than any classical algorithm, check the [**Shor's algorithm** sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/main/samples/algorithms/integer-factorization).

As an example, let's see how we would express the function $f_M(x)=1[r]$ of the factoring problem as a quantum operation in Q#.

Classically, we would compute the remainder of the division $M/x$ and check if it's equal to zero. If it is, the program outputs `1`, and if it's not, the program outputs `0`. We need to:

- Compute the remainder of the division.
- Apply a controlled operation over the output bit so that it's `1` if the remainder is `0`.

So we need to calculate a division of two numbers with a quantum operation. Fortunately, you don't need to write the circuit implementing the division from scratch, you can use the [`DivideI`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic.DivideI) operation from the Numerics library instead.

If we look into the description of `DivideI`, we see that it needs three qubit registers: the $n$-bit dividend `xs`, the $n$-bit divisor `ys`, and the $n$-bit `result` that must be initialized in the state `Zero`. The operation is `Adj + Ctl`, so we can conjugate it and use it in *within-apply* statements. Also, in the description it says that the dividend in the input register `xs` is replaced by the remainder. This is perfect since we are interested exclusively in the remainder, and not in the result of the operation.

We can then build a quantum operation that does the following:

1. Takes three inputs:
   - The dividend, `number : Int`. This is the $M$ in $f_M(x)$.
   - A qubit array encoding the divisor, `divisorRegister : Qubit[]`. This is the $x$ in $f_M(x)$, possibly in a superposition state.
   - A target qubit, `target : Qubit`, that flips if the output of $f_M(x)$ is $1$.
1. Calculates the division $M/x$ using only reversible quantum operations, and flips the state of `target` if and only if the remainder is zero.
1. Reverts all operations except the flipping of `target`, so as to return the used auxiliary qubits to the zero state without introducing irreversible operations, such as measurement. This step is important in order to preserve entanglement and superposition during the process.

The code to implement this quantum operation is:

```qsharp
operation MarkDivisor (
    dividend : Int,
    divisorRegister : Qubit[],
    target : Qubit
) : Unit is Adj + Ctl {
    // Calculate the bit-size of the dividend.
    let size = BitSizeI(dividend);
    // Allocate two new qubit registers for the dividend and the result.
    use dividendQubits = Qubit[size];
    use resultQubits = Qubit[size];
    // Create new LittleEndian instances from the registers to use DivideI
    let xs = LittleEndian(dividendQubits);
    let ys = LittleEndian(divisorRegister);
    let result = LittleEndian(resultQubits);

    // Start a within-apply statement to perform the operation.
    within {
        // Encode the dividend in the register.
        ApplyXorInPlace(dividend, xs);
        // Apply the division operation.
        DivideI(xs, ys, result);
        // Flip all the qubits from the remainder.
        ApplyToEachA(X, xs!);
    } apply {
        // Apply a controlled NOT over the flipped remainder.
        Controlled X(xs!, target);
        // The target flips if and only if the remainder is 0.
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> We take advantage of the statement *within-apply* to achieve step 3. Alternatively, we could explicitly write the adjoints of each of the operations inside the `within` block after the controlled flipping of `target`. The *within-apply* statement does it for us, making the code shorter and more readable. One of the main goals of Q# is to make quantum programs easy to write and read.

### Transform the operation into a phase oracle

The operation `MarkDivisor` is what's known as a *marking oracle*, since it marks the valid items with an entangled auxiliary qubit (`target`). However, Grover's algorithm needs a *phase oracle*, that is, an oracle that applies a conditional phase shift of $-1$ for the solution items. But don't panic, the operation above wasn't written in vain. It's very easy to switch from one oracle type to the other in Q#.

We can apply any marking oracle as a phase oracle with the following operation:

```qsharp
operation ApplyMarkingOracleAsPhaseOracle(
    markingOracle : (Qubit[], Qubit) => Unit is Adj,
    register : Qubit[]
) : Unit is Adj {
    use target = Qubit();
    within {
        X(target);
        H(target);
    } apply {
        markingOracle(register, target);
    }
}
```

This famous transformation is often known as the *phase kickback* and it's widely used in many quantum computing algorithms. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique in this [Microsoft Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/4-implement-quantum-oracle).

## Factoring numbers with Grover's search

Now we have all the ingredients to implement a particular instance of Grover's search algorithm and solve our factoring problem.

Let's use the program below to find a factor of 21. To simplify the code, let's assume that we know the number $M$ of valid items. In this case, $M=4$, since there are two factors, 3 and 7, plus 1 and 21 itself.

```qsharp
namespace GroversTutorial {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Math;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Convert;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation;

    @EntryPoint()
    operation FactorizeWithGrovers(number : Int) : Unit {

        // Define the oracle that for the factoring problem.
        let markingOracle = MarkDivisor(number, _, _);
        let phaseOracle = ApplyMarkingOracleAsPhaseOracle(markingOracle, _);
        // Bit-size of the number to factorize.
        let size = BitSizeI(number);
        // Estimate of the number of solutions.
        let nSolutions = 4;
        // The number of iterations can be computed using the formula.
        let nIterations = Round(PI() / 4.0 * Sqrt(IntAsDouble(size) / IntAsDouble(nSolutions)));

        // Initialize the register to run the algorithm
        use (register, output) = (Qubit[size], Qubit());
        mutable isCorrect = false;
        mutable answer = 0;
        // Use a Repeat-Until-Succeed loop to iterate until the solution is valid.
        repeat {
            RunGroversSearch(register, phaseOracle, nIterations);
            let res = MultiM(register);
            set answer = BoolArrayAsInt(ResultArrayAsBoolArray(res));
            // Check that if the result is a solution with the oracle.
            markingOracle(register, output);
            if MResetZ(output) == One and answer != 1 and answer != number {
                set isCorrect = true;
            }
            ResetAll(register);
        } until isCorrect;

        // Print out the answer.
        Message($"The number {answer} is a factor of {number}.");

    }

    operation MarkDivisor (
        dividend : Int,
        divisorRegister : Qubit[],
        target : Qubit
    ) : Unit is Adj+Ctl {
        let size = BitSizeI(dividend);
        use (dividendQubits, resultQubits) = (Qubit[size], Qubit[size]);
        let xs = LittleEndian(dividendQubits);
        let ys = LittleEndian(divisorRegister);
        let result = LittleEndian(resultQubits);
        within{
            ApplyXorInPlace(dividend, xs);
            DivideI(xs, ys, result);
            ApplyToEachA(X, xs!);
        }
        apply{
            Controlled X(xs!, target);
        }
    }

    operation PrepareUniformSuperpositionOverDigits(digitReg : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj + Ctl {
        PrepareArbitraryStateCP(ConstantArray(10, ComplexPolar(1.0, 0.0)), LittleEndian(digitReg));
    }

    operation ApplyMarkingOracleAsPhaseOracle(
        markingOracle : (Qubit[], Qubit) => Unit is Adj,
        register : Qubit[]
    ) : Unit is Adj {
        use target = Qubit();
        within {
            X(target);
            H(target);
        } apply {
            markingOracle(register, target);
        }
    }

    operation RunGroversSearch(register : Qubit[], phaseOracle : ((Qubit[]) => Unit is Adj), iterations : Int) : Unit {
        ApplyToEach(H, register);
        for _ in 1 .. iterations {
            phaseOracle(register);
            ReflectAboutUniform(register);
        }
    }

    operation ReflectAboutUniform(inputQubits : Qubit[]) : Unit {
        within {
            ApplyToEachA(H, inputQubits);
            ApplyToEachA(X, inputQubits);
        } apply {
            Controlled Z(Most(inputQubits), Tail(inputQubits));
        }
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to be able to use operations from the numerics library (or any other library besides the standard library), we need to make sure the corresponding package has been [added to our project](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview.using). For a quick way to do so in VS Code, open the terminal from within your project and run the following command: `dotnet add package Microsoft.Quantum.Numerics`

### Run it with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

The program above will run the operation or function marked with the `@EntryPoint()` attribute on a simulator or resource estimator, depending on the project configuration and command-line options.

In Visual Studio, simply press Ctrl + F5 to run the script.

In VS Code, build the `Program.qs` the first time by typing the below in the terminal:

```Command line
dotnet build
```

For subsequent runs, there is no need to build it again. To run it, type the following command and press enter:

```Command line
dotnet run --no-build --number 21
```

After pressing enter, you should see the following message displayed in the terminal:

```Command line
The number 7 is a factor of 21.
```

## Extra: check the statistics with Python

How can you check that the algorithm is behaving correctly? For example, if we substituted Grover's search by a random number generator in the code above, after ~$N$ attempts it will also find a factor.

Let's write a small Python script to check that the program is working as it should.

> [!TIP]
> If you need help running Q# applications within Python, you can take a look at our guide about the [ways to run a Q# program](xref:microsoft.quantum.user-guide-qdk.overview.host-programs) and the [installation guide for Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview.python).

First, we are going to modify our main operation to get rid of the repeat-until-success loop, instead outputting the first measurement result after running Grover's search:

```qsharp
@EntryPoint()
operation FactorizeWithGrovers2(number : Int) : Int {

    let markingOracle = MarkDivisor(number, _, _);
    let phaseOracle = ApplyMarkingOracleAsPhaseOracle(markingOracle, _);
    let size = BitSizeI(number);
    let nSolutions = 4;
    let nIterations = Round(PI() / 4.0 * Sqrt(IntAsDouble(size) / IntAsDouble(nSolutions)));

    use register = Qubit[size] {
        RunGroversSearch(register, phaseOracle, nIterations);
        let res = MultiM(register);
        return ResultArrayAsInt(res);
        // Check whether the result is correct.
    }

}
```

Note that we changed the output type from `Unit` to `Int`. This will be useful for the Python program.

The Python program is very simple. It just calls the operation `FactorizeWithGrovers2` several times and plots the results in a histogram.

The code is the following:

```python
import qsharp
qsharp.packages.add("Microsoft.Quantum.Numerics")
qsharp.reload()
from GroversTutorial import FactorizeWithGrovers2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def main():

    # Instantiate variables
    frequency =  {}
    N_Experiments = 1000
    results = []
    number = 21

    # Run N_Experiments times the Q# operation.
    for i in range(N_Experiments):
        print(f'Experiment: {i} of {N_Experiments}')
        results.append(FactorizeWithGrovers2.simulate(number = number))

    # Store the results in a dictionary
    for i in results:
        if i in frequency:c
            frequency[i]=frequency[i]+1
        else:
            frequency[i]=1

    # Sort and print the results
    frequency = dict(reversed(sorted(frequency.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])))
    print('Output,  Frequency' )
    for k, v in frequency.items():
        print(f'{k:<8} {v}')

    # Plot an histogram with the results
    plt.bar(frequency.keys(), frequency.values())
    plt.xlabel("Output")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency of the outputs")
    plt.title("Outputs for Grover's factoring. N=21, 1000 iterations")
    plt.xticks(np.arange(1, 33, 2.0))
    plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

> [!NOTE]
> The line `from GroversTutorial import FactorizeWithGrovers2` in the Python program imports the Q# code we've written previously. Note that the Python module name (`GroversTutorial`) needs to be identical to the Namespace of the operation we want to import (in this case, `FactorizeWithGrovers2`).

The program generates the following histogram:

![Histogram with the results of running several time the Grover's algorithm](~/media/grovers-histogram.png)

As you can see in the histogram, the algorithm outputs the solutions to the search problem (1, 3, 7 and 21) with much higher probability than the non-solutions. You can think of Grover's algorithm as a quantum random generator that is purposefully biased towards those indices that are solutions to the search problem.

## Next steps

Now that you know how to implement Grover's algorithm, try to transform a mathematical problem into a search task and solve it with Q# and Grover's algorithm.
